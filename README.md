This is a research project aimed at studying political polarization on Twitter. We focus our attention on the trends observed in the aftermath of President Trump firing FBI Director James Comey, or from May 10th through 29th..

This project has three phases: **data collection**, **ideology estimation**, and **polarization analysis**. At a high level, these are described by:
 * **Data Collection**: collecting tweets on this event, and extracting the retweets and the population of users associated with them.
 * **Ideology Estimation**: estimating the political ideologies of the population through correspondence analysis, and verifying that this ideology is meaningful.
 * **Polarization Analysis**: developing measures of political polarization over time and analyzing them.

## Methods
Coming soon!

This project was completed for the [Seminar on Algorithms and Society](http://www.psacomputing.org/algsoc/basics/) course at Northwestern, taught by Prof. Brent Hecht. My work was based on the paper authored by Pablo Barbera, a member of the Social Media and Political Participation Lab at NYU:

    Barber√°, Pablo, et al. "Tweeting from left to right: Is online political communication more than an echo chamber?." *Psychological science* 26.10 (2015): 1531-1542.

A great deal of my code was based off [theirs](https://github.com/pablobarbera/echo_chambers), and for this I am grateful.
